## Context: 

First Redline Project
This was an exercise given by BeCode with the task to recreate a website for an architect company.
There is a picture gallery on the first page that contains 8 images. It is an automatic set-time image gallery. You can't physically slide the images.

## What is the red line project?
* The red line project is what it says in the name: It is a series of projects that allows us to see whether you have learned something from the exercises we give you and how far along you are in the knowledge that we are working on.

## How does it work?
* We will give you assignments throughout the training that will have to do with the current material. Once done we will see how well they have been executed and sometimes even hand out badges depending on the quality of the exercise. (more on this later)
